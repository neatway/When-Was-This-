            <li>Any other personal or sensitive data</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Data Storage</h2>
        <p>The only data stored by the app is your game progress, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your current score</li>
            <li>Your streak count</li>
            <li>History of photos you've guessed</li>

        <p><strong>This data is stored locally on your device only</strong> and never transmitted to any server or third party. If you delete the app, this data is permanently removed from your device.</p>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>When Was This? does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. The app functions entirely offline and does not connect to the internet.</p>

        <h2>Photo Content</h2>
        <p>All historical photos included in the app are sourced from Wikimedia Commons and are either in the public domain or used under Creative Commons licenses. No user-generated content is collected or stored.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>While we don't collect data, the game progress stored locally on your device is protected by your device's built-in security features (encryption, passcode, etc.).</p>

        <h2>California Privacy Rights</h2>
        <p>Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), California residents have certain rights regarding their personal information. Since When Was This? does not collect any personal information, these rights are not applicable.</p>

        <h2>GDPR Compliance</h2>
